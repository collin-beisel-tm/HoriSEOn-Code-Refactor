## Description
- This application was built to create a home page for clients to learn about Horiseon's SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing services.

- This home page teaches potential clients of Horiseon about the services they offer.

- This application is built by an unknown developer using soley HTML and CSS. I have gone through the html and css to optimize the application for SEO, and performance by adding alt tags, updating colors to be ada compliant, adding semantic html, and consolidating css selectors.
